# Team Project - COVID Pulse


### Problem Statement
With the current COVID-19 crisis engulfing the world and rapidly spreading across the US,
there is a lot of data available surrounding case counts and outcomes. That said, 
a lot of this data currently comes only in a raw form. With this API, we aim to expose endpoints
that software developers can use to programmatically access COVID-19 case counts by county and state
in the US, so that this crucial data can be easily integrated into any application.
