# Weekly Reflection

### Week 1

3/31/2020 - ### hours

Tasks Completed:
    * VM Environment Setup
    * Individual Project Selection

It took us a few days of thought--but not too many--to come up with an idea; we opted to do something that was relevant to
our daily lives this semester: COVID-19. Some research lead us to the following two data sources:    
    * [HealthData.org - COVID Information](http://www.healthdata.org/covid)
    * [GitHub Repository - New York Times COVID-19 Case Tracking](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)

After some discussion as a team, we opted ot use the GitHub resource that used a .csv of New York Times data. This data, we thought, 
would have broader applications to other developer projects beyond the HealthData.org information that was more specific to hospital capacity.
